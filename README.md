# TNT Group Construction Website

I built this responsive website using React.JS and CSS. I enjoyed designing the website and implementing the functions and learning more about using React.

## Problems & Solutions 💭

**Here are some challenges I had:**

> **Creating slideshow functionality:**
>
> - I used the Slide component from "react-slideshow-image" and used CSS to create the smooth transition effect.

> **Creating a Modal:**
>
> - I used the Form component from "semantic-ui-react" and then used openModal and closeModal functionalities using useState.
